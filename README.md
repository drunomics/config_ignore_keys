# Fork

This is a temporary fork of https://www.drupal.org/project/config_ignore_keys until https://www.drupal.org/project/config_ignore_keys/issues/3143436
got fixed.

PURPOSE OF THIS VERSION
-----------------------
There is a patch for Drupal 9 compatibility, but because of:
https://www.mediacurrent.com/blog/how-fix-catch-22-problem-drupal-9-fixes-composer/
patch is not a working solution so new Drupal 9 compatible version is required.
